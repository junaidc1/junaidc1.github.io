        <p>The processor, better known as the central processing unit <span class="body">(CPU)</span>, is a chip housed on the motherboard. The CPU acts like a very efficient calculator that processes data from the software and hardware and since it is always computing, it is covered by a heat sink that keeps the processor cool.</p>
        <p>CPU's main function is to take input from peripherals like the keyboard, mouse, or a program and execute on what it might need. It could be the movement of the mouse, press of a key, or combination of both running a specific program. Since the CPU is only responding to input data, the electrical signals going in a out of the CPU are traveling very much near the speed of light.</p>
        <p>The first CPU was developed by Intel&reg; in 1971, called the 4004 processor. Computer technology has improved exponentially since then. A good example of which is the 4004 processor chip had 2,300 transistors and performed 60,000 operations per second. The Intel&reg; Pentium processor chip was released in 1993 with 3,300,000 transistors, which performed roughly 188,000,000 operations per second.</p>

        <p>Random access memory, or <span class="body">RAM</span>, also lives on the motherboard and is the memory of a computer. It stores and retrieves application data on a computer and since the data is accessed randomly instead of sequentially, it performs faster than a CD or hard drive.</p>
        <p>As a computer boots up, parts of the software get loaded up into the RAM for faster launch. Users can even have intructions in the RAM to load specific programs as soon as the computer is booted for faster access. A computer's performance can be attributed to the amount of RAM installed in the machine; the higher the RAM, the faster the software can be loaded. RAM is temporary memory; meaning nothing is stored long term and when the computer is powered off, RAM is cleared as well.</p>
        <p>It is fairly easy to upgrade RAM on all sorts of computers and laptops. Although usually not upgradable, modern smart phones also use a similar type of solid-state memory. The largest stick of RAM on the market right now is 128GB but every computer's processor might not be suitable to support it.</p>
